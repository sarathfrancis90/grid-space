# src/versions/

## What's Here
Version history sidebar: timeline, diff view, preview mode, restore button, named versions.

## Patterns to Follow
- Use authStore for current user
- Use React Router for navigation
- Loading skeletons while data fetches
- Error boundaries for failed API calls

## Do NOT
- Import from server/ — frontend and backend are separate
- Use any or @ts-ignore — fix the types
