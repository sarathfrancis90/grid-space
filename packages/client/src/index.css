/*
 * Fix Tailwind v4 preflight vs utility padding/margin conflict.
 *
 * Tailwind v4 preflight sets `padding: 0; margin: 0` on `*` using physical
 * shorthands. Utility classes like `px-3` generate `padding-inline` (logical).
 * When both physical and logical properties target the same side, the one
 * declared LATER in the same cascade context is the "active" property.
 *
 * Problem: The preflight's physical `padding: 0` on `*` remains "active" for
 * the inline/block directions, so utility-layer logical properties can't
 * override them (they're different CSS properties competing for the same side).
 *
 * Fix: Re-declare the `*` reset using BOTH physical AND logical properties.
 * Since our logical declarations come after the physical shorthand within the
 * same rule, they become the "active" properties for each direction. Then
 * utility-layer rules (which also use logical properties) properly override
 * them via the cascade.
